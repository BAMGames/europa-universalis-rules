A quick guide to the EU9 "Fast battle" system.


***********  Disclaimer ***************
The fast battle system is part of the EU9 rewrite of the rules. It is
more or less from the rest of the rules and can be used in a regular (6
players) game with only minor adaptation to some points.

This guide is intended for people who know the usual (EU6) battle
system. It is not a complete set of rules and is not intended to be
one. It's only to keep people waiting until the rules are written... The
goal of this guide is to allow people knowing the EU6 battle system to
use the fast battle system.
***************************************

* Before reading this guide, you'll need an up-to-date version of the
  EU9 player aids which can be found at
  http://bamgames.free.fr/Europa/EU8/euTables.pdf

Pages 1-3 don't concern aspects modified by the fast battle and can thus
be ignored.
Pages 9-20 contain the country specific tables. These are rewrite of the
EU6 country tables adapted to the fast battle.

"Fast battle" changes the way battle are handled but also has
repercussions on the logistic and many other parts of the military
system.

From the logistic point of view, troops, either naval or land, are no
more counted individually (infantry, cavalry, artillery) but only as
whole detachments, either land (LD) or naval (ND). There are also Galley
Detachments (GD) for use in the Mediterranean (and a bit in the Baltic).

As a general rule, there is the following rule of conversion:
1A+ = 4LD and 1A- = 2LD.

Basic upkeep as well as purchase costs (and purchase limits) are
modified and only deal with full detachments. See the country specific
tables (pages 9-20).

EG, in period I, POR now upkeeps (for free) 4ND and 2LD (2nd table on
page 9). During upkeep phase, the D can be converted in A/F. So, POR can
choose to upkeep 1F+(=4ND) and 1A-(=2LD). If POR wants to upkeep an A+,
then he must pay the cost corresponding to A- (because A- is upkeeped
for free, so only the other half of the army has to be paid for) that is
8D$ for a medieval veteran army.

* Warning ! there is a new rule concerning the exploitation of
  wood. Thus, naval upkeep has reduced (wood providing the extra
  upkeep). If needed, compare the old and new tables and raise the naval
  upkeep as needed.

* Warning ! The equivalence F+=4ND is true *only* during upkeep. At any
  other moment (purchase, battle, ...) F+ have contents changing with
  periods and countries. EG, Russian F+ contains 3ND and 1 Transport
  Detachment in period III but become 7ND/2DTr in period VII (first
  table of page 11). You must still write down the precise content of
  each fleet but only as a number of detachments... Notice that even a
  7/2 fleet is upkeeped for 4ND (equivalence F+=4ND during upkeep).

  During purchase, the cost indicated for F- is the cost for a *full*
  F-, so up to 3ND+1DTr at some point.

It is no more necessarily to write down the contents of armies. 1A- is
*always* exactly 2LD and 1A+ is *always* exactly 4LD.


Purchase limits of each country can be read in the "troop purchase"
column of the second table.

Purchase limits, as well as fleet sizes, are also grouped on global
tables at pages 2 (troop purchase in LD), 3 (navy purchase in ND) and 4
(fleet sizes).

As usual, it is impossible to go beyond the naval purchase limit but the
land purchase limit can be exceeded by paying once, twice or three time
the written cost if one need to go to 1, 2, or 3 times the limit.

* Remark: upkeeps contain a column "at peace" where upkeep is more
  expensive than at war. We wanted to prevent people from qtarting wars
  with all their troops raised, hence a more expensive upkeep at
  peace. If wanted, ignore this column and only use the usual
  Conscript/Veteran at war upkeep.


OK, let's start the military stuff itself...
* 1st golden rule: One can only stack up to 3 counters and never more
  than 8LD (plus 2 pashas for TUR).

  The 3 counter limits allows to stack 7LD...
  The 8LD limit corresponds to 2A+ (the EU6 limit).
  It is now possible to have A+A-A- (3 counters and 8LD).

  At sea, the stacking limit is 3 counters. Including 3F+ if one wants. 

* 2nd golden rule: It is impossible to create new A counter out of the
  purchase phase. Otherwise, it is always possible to transform and
  transfer (between counters of the same nation) as long as the total
  number of LD is respected.

  Only A counters contains artillery, which should not appear out of
  nothing.
  Hence the cost of the Russian A-... Notice that RUS buys his A+ by
  buying A- and 2LD and merging them.
  It is possible to merge A- and 2LD into A+. It is possible to split
  1A+ into A- and 2LD or 4LD.


The rest... well, it's almost as in EU6 :-)
First, some easy tables.

Page 4:
* "Sea transport for armies" (below). The number of transport point per
  A+ depending on the period and the army class. Army classes are on the
  top table of page 6 (or on the new counters).
* "Movement point costs". AFAICT unchanged since EU6.

Page 5 :
* "Replacement leaders". Instead of using counters for the duration of a
  single battle, use this table to draw a replacement leader when
  needed.
* "Wind avantage determination". Unchanged.
* "Interception an evasion". Unchanged. Slightly adapted. 
  [Ignore any stuff referring to arsenals if not using the new map]
* "Naval/Land Technology Table". Grouping of the EU6 tables. Mostly unchanged.

Page 6 :
* "Army Classes". Gives the army class of each country (read line by
  line, the first and last columns). utility of the other columns will
  come later.

Page 7 :
* "Siegework". Siege table. Basically unchanged.
* "Artillery per A+". Number of artillery point per A+ (divide by 2 for
  A-) per country/army class and per period.


OK. Back to page 4 to deal with stuff in order...

* "Campaign cost". We have changed the cost for campaigns in order to
  restrict the systematic use of stacks of 2A+ and have thing more
  historically accurate (in our opinion).

A "small stack" on land is a stack of at most 5LD (and 1 pasha) and at
sea at most 1 F counter.

A passive campaign cost 10D$, as before, and allows, as before to move
but not to make any aggressive move (no moving in enemy territory, no
interception in enemy territory, no moving on revolts or pirates ; it is
possible to move and intercept in friendly territory, maintain siege of
fight against revolts/pirates and conduct exploration (and killing of
natives)).

A simple campaign cost 20D$. In addition to the passive one, it allows
to intercept in enemy territory (during the next movement phase of the
enemy) and act aggressively with one small land stack *and* one small
sea stack.

Remark: before moving, one is supposed to have done only a passive
campaign. Hence, the player with initiative can, during first round,
move at home without any risk of interception. If he only make a passive
campaign, then the other player can also move at home without
trouble. However, if the player with initiative choose to conduct a
simple campaign (even without moving into enemy territory, but the
choice of campaign must be announced) then, during his opponent move
he'll be able to intercept an army moving in enemy territory.

Remark 2: the size of an interception stack is not restricted by the
chosen campaign, as well as the number of interception per round. Hence,
interceptions can be a good way to turn low cost campaigns into high
cost one...

Example: FRA is at war with SPA and has the initiative. FRA choose a
simple campaign and move 2A+ into Champagne and 2A+ into Picardie. Since
both are friendly controlled, this can be done with a simple
campaign. Now SPA moves troops from Liege to Hainault and some other
troops from Vlaanderen to Flandres. Since FRA has paid for a simple
campaign, he can intercept into enemy territory and perform both
interception (from Champagne to Hainault and from Picardie to Flandres)
with 2A+ each. If both interceptions succeed, then the result for FRA is
almost as good as a multiple campaign for the cost of a simple one... If
FRA had only paid for a passive campaign, then he would have been unable
to intercept in enemy territory (but could have intercepted is the
Spanish troops had continued their move into, say Artois and the ÃŽle de
France). [Notice that if SPA was on the defencive, bringing troops to
the frontier in such a case is a very bed move and it would have been
better to wait at home and let FRA spend his money to attack...]

A major campaign cost 50D$ and allows to move "aggressively" either:
* one stack, without restriction (except the stacking limit of the first
  golden rule).
* As many small stacks as wanted.
[the first choice is basically EU6 active campaign]

The choice has to be made for land and sea and can be different for
each. So, it is possible with a major campaign to move 1 large sea stack
(of up to 3 F+) and several small land stacks.

A multiple campaign cost 100D$ and allows to move without additional
restrictions (like inEU6).


Good... Now, the phase of each player/alliance during each round are
split as follows:
(player 1)
  supply segment
  movement segment (+interception from player 2)
  battle segment
(player 2)
  idem
...
(player n, if needed)
  idem

siege segment

[next round]



Supply segment:
* Check if troops are in supply.
* Troops which are out of supply since last round are automatically
  destroyed.
* Troops in weak supply must roll for attrition.

Line of Supply (LoS): the LoS goes from the Source of Supply (SoS)
(controlled city) and goes to the army. A LoS can cross sea if there is
a large enough fleet adjacent to the army needing supply. A small stack
(5LD or less) can be supplied by 1F counter or at least 2ND. A large
stack can be supplied by at least 1F+ (full) or at least 3ND. A single
sea stack cannot supply several land stacks.


Cold area: If you're using the new map, then there is a cold area in the
North (white border) as well as in the ROTW (snowflake "resource"). If
you're not using the new round system (a bit strange with the new map,
but well...) then double the cost of each non-national territory
province while computing LoS length.

If you're using the new round system, then after each "W" round
(including those skipped due to a S->S transition), troops in a
non-controlled non-national cold area province must roll for attrition
(in ROTW, add a malus equal to the number under the snowflake).


Out of supply:
The LoS is strictly more than 12MP.

Weak Supply (recalled in the "Supply Segment"/Weak land supply" table in
the top left of page 4):
* LoS is between 6 and 12MP (included). Except for lone LD in the ROTW
  (they still need a LoS but don't suffer from its length).
* LoS goes through a non-national territory desert (if standing in the
  same province as the source of supply, then it's OK, if standing in a
  adjacent province but the SoS is in a desert, then the LoS cross the
  desert...)
* SoS not possessed (only controlled).
* Troops supplied by a fleet not adjacent to a friendly port (or arsenal
  if used).
* besieged troops.

Fleets never roll for attrition during the supply segment.

Attrition roll is made on the top table of page 4. DRM are written below
the table. Mainly: +6/+8 for land attrition inside friendly/enemy
territory ; +1 per pillage ; -MAN of the leader ; +2 for a large stack.
The result is to be sought in the column "Attr." of the table (2nd
column, hence nothing happen on a result of 11 or less) and next read in
the column corresponding to the size of the stack (in LD).

The numbers correspond to lost LD. The 'P' result is explained on the
right, it is either a pillage or (and) one lost LD depending on the
technology.
Remark: the pillage is put on the - face. Hence if nothing more happen,
it is removed at the end of the turn and doesn't hamper income (but it
is here for the rest of the turn and may hamper further attrition
rolls...)



Movement segment:
Basically, as before. Choose your campaign, and move your troops. One
must roll for attrition in the following cases:
* Any large land stack. Even if it does not move (usually, if staying at
  home it is possible to split and re-merge the stack to avoid rolling
  for attrition but since there is a movement, this may trigger
  interception... While besieging,n this is usually not possible (or
  wishable) because re-entering the siege is an aggressive move and cost
  more).
* Any sea stack not at port. Even an immobile sea stack at sea must roll
  for attrition.
* Any land stack embarking or disembarking out of a controlled port
  (arsenal). If the transport goes from a friendly port to a friendly
  port, then no need to roll for attrition.
* Any land stack moving 6MP or more.
* Any land stack moving 3MP or more during poor weather.

Remark: it is possible to pay for a low cost simple campaign (usually
when playing RUS or POL) for only 10D$. in this case, being a stack of
3LD or more is an extra cause of attrition.

Main attrition modifiers are:
* At land:
  +8 if entering at least one enemy province, +6 otherwise.
  +1/+2 per pillage -/+ in a province.
  -MAN of the leader.
  +2 per extra attrition cause.
     [ie a large stack moving 6MP during poor weather and disembarking
     on a enemy beach has 4 causes of attrition: a/ large stack, b/ 6MP,
     c/ 3MP during poor weather, d/ disembarking out of friendly
     port. Hence it will make an attrition roll at +6 (3 extra causes of
     attrition) (plus other modifiers, including certainly the +8 for
     entering an enemy province, better have a good MAN and roll 1 when
     doing such things...)]
* At sea:
  -MAN of the leader.
  +2 if poor weather.
  +? largest difficulty of a sea zone crossed (or difficulty of the sea
  zone if staying in one place). Reduce the difficulty of seas with a
  port on the zone by 2.
  +1 per full group of 4 seas zones entered during movement.
  +3 for a F counter starting its move not adjacent to a controlled
  port.
  +6 for a F counter starting its move at 2 or more sea zones of a
  friendly port.
  +9 if at 5+ sea zones from port [to be included]
     (Remark: use ND for exploration ! rolling at +14 in the middle of
     the Pacific is not a good idea)
  +X specific malus of the seas (eg Cape of Good Hope, ...)
  +3/+6 if 2/3 F counters.
  +/-?  according to naval technology.

At land, read the result as previously.
At sea, find the line in the column "Attr." (again, no attrition on a
result of 11 or less) and read the result in the (poorly named) "ROTW
loss" column. The result is a percentage of loss (basically as before).
If needed, the table below ("Remaining troops after attrition") gives
what's left of the fleet according to its initial size (line) and the %
of loss (column). 'D' is 1ND, 'd' is an "exploration detachment",
corresponding to 1/3 of a ND.

eg, if 4ND suffer 20% attrition, by crossing the line 4D with the column
20%, we can sea that only 3 remains, ie 3ND.

At land in the ROTW: use the percentage (and the "ROTW loss" column).

The naval "d" may exist in Europe. The land "d" are destroyed when
entering Europe [In the ROTW, we need something smaller than a LD to
represent the explorations of the early game].



Exploration :
* One always make first a movement in order of go to a province/sea zone
  adjacent to the one to explore (may consist in staying in the same
  place), including attrition if needed (eg at sea) and then an
  exploration.
* For exploration, the only modifier is the MAN (and the malus of the
  sea). The line is found on the column "Expl." (hence losses happen
  with a result of 2 or more) and the result is then read in the columns
  "Discovery" and "ROTW loss". Basically, as before.

Interception :
It is possible to intercept enemy troops entering a province. Basically
unchanged. See the modifiers on page 5. 

[there are some more or less complicated rules about interception,
counter interception, locking troops and so on. Even is Pierre swear the
contrary, I have the feeling that these things change at every play
session... So I won't take the risk of writing down the whole
interception system. Especially since it is not modified by the fast
battle... You can very well use any interception system suiting you with
the fast battle.]


Battle:
BanzaÃ¯!
* if needed, roll for a replacement leader (page 5).
* Look for the columns of the CRT according to the technologies (as
  before).
* Go to page 6...

(below the table for replacement leaders stands a summary of the whole
battle sequence).

A battle lasts at most 3 days. Each day consists in one Fire and one
Shock.

Each Fire (and Shock) is rolled for on the CRT on page 6. Basically in
the same way as before: 1d10+modifiers, in the corresponding column,
gives both losses (number) and moral losses (stars).
* After each Fire/Shock, an army with no more moral routs.
* At then end of the first day, an army which is entirely destroyed
  (taking into account the size modifiers, see below) loses the battle.
* At the end of the first day, each army can try to retreat by rolling
  less then MAN+moral (remaining). In case of failure, opponent will get
  +1/+1 during second day (effectively cancelling the -1/-1 of second
  day).
* At the end of the second day, the winner is the army with more
 remaining moral. In case of equality, the battle is a tie.

Main modifiers:
* fire/shock differential (if positive).
* Malus in non-plain provinces.
* -1/+1 for Fire if 0/6 artillery in the army (this malus/bonus can be
  obtained by both opponents).See page 7 for the number of artillery per
  A.
* +1 to Shock if 3LD more than opponent.
* Cavalry bonus for specific countries in specific terrains and
  periods.

During a battle, sum the loss inflicted.

At the end of the battle, the winner roll for pursuit (nobody in case of
a tie) like in EU6. Pursuit may add losses as well as causing a rout.

Once both days and pursuit are done, losses must be corrected according
to 2 factors (this replace the tedious percentage computation of EU6):
* Losses are meant for stacks of 8LD. Smaller stacks should cause less
  losses.
* Turkish armies were larger than the Spanish ones, losses must be
  corrected according to relative army size (army composition (in I/C/A)
  disappeared and must reappear somewhere...)

* The first change is pretty easy. One looks into the "Loss Modification
  for small stacks" table in the column corresponding to the number of
  LD *of one own stack* and one subtracts the indicated number to the
  losses caused.

  Remark: this should be a multiplicative modifiers rather than an
  additive one... However, this is much simple this way and tests have
  shown a good behaviour...

* The second change is a bit harder...
  First one has to find the relative size of the armies. The table "Army
  Classes", on top, gives the size of each army according to its classe
  and the period [Remark: it's already relative sizes, ie an army of
  size 0 is not composed of 0 men... and a size diminishing usually
  indicates an increase in the size of neighbours rather than a
  diminution of own troops...]
  Next, the size of both armies is compared in the "Size comparison"
  table in order to find a number between -2 and +2 (the table is
  symmetrical, hence if I get -1, my opponent will get +1).
  [Or one can compute the difference between sizes, divide by 3 and
  round to the closest integer, ie a size difference of 1 yields +0, a
  size difference of +2, +3, +4 yields +1/-1 and a size difference of
  +5, +6, +7 yields +2/-2]
  Next, one looks in the table "Loss Modification by Size". Finding the
  number of losses caused in the "-1/0" line gives a column, in this
  column the actual number of losses is found on the line corresponding
  to one own modifier.

Remark: this second step looks tedious... Actually, relative size with
your favourite opponent are quickly known and don't change that often
and only the last part has to be done at every battle. (eg, FRA is
always at +1 against SPA, and always at +1 against ENG except during
period VII, ...)

Lastly, any not winning army (ie both in case of tie) roll for retreat
on the "Retreat Losses" table, subtracting the MAN of the general if
it's not a rout.

In Europe, losses are rounded to the nearest integer (in the ROTW, 'd'
exist and correspond to 1/3 of LD).

If there was a rout *and* at least 3LD more losses for the looser, the
this if a major battle.
[this happens more often than in EU6 and this is a voluntary choice. If
you want a behaviour similar to EU6, make it 4LD more losses to trigger
a major battle.]

Exception: if the size modifier was +2, then you need 4LD more loss to
trigger a major battle.




Example (otherwise this is probably a bit obfuscated...):
Somewhere in the Italian plains, 5LD (A+, LD) of Spanish tercios
encounter 2 french A+ coming from the Alps. Both have Arquebuse
technology and veteran troops. Hence the moral is 3 for the Frenches
(2+1) and 4 for the Spanish (2+1 for the veterans, +1 for the
tercios). Columns of the CRT are C/B for Fire/Shock.

Concerning leaders, FRA has +2 to Fire and SPA has +1 to Shock.
Concerning terrain, this is plain, hence no modification.

With 2A+, FRA has 6 artillery [hum, actually this is not exactly true
since we've also changed the way to compute the number of artillery in
stacks with several tokens, but let's assume we use the old way to
compute the number of artillery and FRA has 3 artillery per A+, hence 6
total], hence +1 to Fire. SPA has only 3 artillery hence neither bonus
nor malus.

FRA is class IV, hence he'll get a +1 cavalry bonus in period III... too
early.
SPA is tercios, hence FRA has a -1 to Shock ("Other technology
modifiers").
FRA has 3DT more than SPA (8 vs 5), hence +1 to Shock.

Final modifiers:
FRA : +3/0.
SPA :  0/+1.

BanzaÃ¯ !
First day, Fire.
FRA rolls 9+3 = 12. 2 1/3**. Losses are divided by 2 (Fire with
Arquebuse), result 1**.
SPA rolls 6+0 = 6. 1/3 divided by 2 gives nothing.

Nobody routs, hence the battle goes on.

First day, Shock.
FRA rolls 6+0 = 6. 2/3.
SPA rolls 7+1 = 8. 1 1/3*.

Nobody routs, the battle goes on.

Since this is the end of day 1, one check whether one side is completely
eliminated. FRA has actually suffered 2/3 losses (1 1/3-2/3 because SPA
only has 5LD), he's still alive. SPA has actually suffered 2 losses (1
2/3 becoming 2 because FRA has +1 size), he's still alive.
Since there are still men in both troops the battle goes on.
[Remark: complete elimination of a troop after day 1 only happens with
small troops (3LD or less) or extreme results (rolling 10 for both Fire
and Shock with good modifiers)]

Since this is the end of day 1, each side has the possibility to try and
retreat.
FRA suffered almost no losses and decide to stay.
SPA has already lost 2** and feel like a major defeat is coming... Since
he has 4 in MAN, he decide to try to flee.
4 MAN + 2 remaining moral, the retreat threshold is 6.
SPA rolls... 7. Caramba !

Second day. SPA gets an additional -1/-1  for second day giving final
modifiers of -1/0.
FRA cancels his -1/-1 of second day by the +1/+1 of failed retreat for
SPA and stays at +3/0.

Notice that the artillery bonus of "3LD more" bonus are not recomputed
between each day and stay the same than in the beginning of the battle.

Second day, Fire.
FRA rolls 3+3 = 6. 1/3 divided by 2 gives nothing.
ESP rolls 10-1 = 9. 1 1/3* divided by 2, gives 2/3*.

Nobody routs, hence the battle goes on.

Second day, Shock;
FRA rolls 7+0 = 7. 1*.
ESP rolls 6+0 = 6. 2/3.

Nobody routs and nobody is completely destroyed.

FRA still has 2 moral (3-1). SPA still has 1 moral (4-2-1). Hence the
Spaniards flee and the Frenches pursuit.
Pursuit is always in column E at +0 here.
FRA rolls 9. 1*. Ouch. The Spanish orderly retreat to previously
prepared positions suddenly turns into a rout !

Summary of the losses (moral plays no more role now):
SPA caused 0 + 1 1/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 2 2/3.
FRA caused 1 + 2/3   + 0   + 1 + 1 = 3 2/3.

SPA only had 5DT. His 2 2/3 become 2.
FRA was 8DT, his 3 2/3 stay the same.

SPA is class III (HISpania), size 0 in period II. FRA is class IV, size
2 in period II.
Size differential is 2, thus giving a +1 to FRA (and -1 to SPA).

On the "-1/0" line, SPA looks for the 2 and then in the same column the
line for "-1"... which is obviously the same so nothing changes [a size
differential of 0 or -1 does not change the losses].

On the "-1/0" line, FRA looks for the 3 and the 2/3. He looks in the
corresponding columns on the line "+1" (below). The 3 becomes 3 2/3 and
the 2/3 stays 2/3. Total : 4 1/3.

SPA must now retreat. Since this is a rout, the MAN of the general
doesn't count. He rolls 3 and adds 1/3 loss.
[Retreat losses are not modified by size.]

In the end, FRA loses 2LD and keep 6LD (A+ A-, it could also be A+ 2LD
but this is not a wise choice since that prevent from getting back to
2A+ by reinforcing the A- (no A may be created), it could not be 3A-
since that would create a third A nor A- 4LD since that would put 5
counters in the stack). SPA loses 4 1/3 + 1/3 = 4 2/3 rounded to 5 (in
Europe). The whole stack is destroyed.

The losses difference is 3LD or more (5 vs 2) and the looser
routed. This is a major victory for the Frenches. (FRA gain 1 STAB, SPA
loses 1 STAB, deal with VP as usual).



Well, that was not so hard :-)




My advice is to roll for a couple of battles before playing just to see
how it looks (at least one of the player should do this and then direct
the other players for their first battles). After a couple of battles,
things should go smoothly.

Another advice is to write down on a draft the result of the battle
after each roll. After 4 rolls, it can be pretty hard to remember every
loss caused...

[the way I write it down is as follows:
* one of the opponent writes everything.
* makes two columns on the sheet. One for the result of each opponent.
* on top of each column, write down the DRM of the corresponding side
  (eg "+1/0"). In the second day, the modifiers are basically the same
  with an additional -1/-1 so you don't need more space for them.
* Write the results in a single line, adding them at each roll. Write
  full losses as lines ("|") and 1/3 of losses as dots on top of
  another. Hence, when you add several 1/3, you first put a single dot,
  then a second one below, then connect both dots (3/3=1) in a
  line. Write moral losses as stars.
* in the end, you just need to count the number of lines and add dots if
  needed.
* For the next battle, you can reuse the same two columns. Simply draw
  an horizontal line to separate one battle from another.

Obviously, there are other way to write down the result of a
battle... Just find one you're comfortable with and use it...]


Remark: Size modifiers of -2/+2  can only happen with armies of size 7
(no size 5 or 6) hence RUS/TUR/Native against western armies in the
early to mid game.

Remark 2: there are summary of the battle sequence on pages 5 and 6.


Well, at sea things are globally similar except that the size
differential now depends on the number of ND in one own stack (the
difference in the number of ND gives bonus to Fire/Shock/Pursuit). Read
the list of modifiers and the summary of naval battle.

Of course, at sea there is always this thing of 1/3 sunk, 1/3 damaged
and 1/3 refitted. This is handled ND by ND. See the Summary. Also at sea
losses are not rounded and 1/3 gives 'd' that can stay in Europe.




Concerning siege (page 7).
For Siegework, things basically stay the same. Same table (a bit
condensed) and same modifiers. We have introduced a new way to compute
the number of artillery per army (see below the siegework table) to give
better result (in our opinion) against large (level 4 or 5) and very
small (fort) fortifications. Feel free to ignore it and compute
artillery per army in the usual way.

The main modification for the siegework concerns the siege attrition
which can now happen even with a large result.
As stated next to the siegwork table, the die roll is compared to the
length of the LoS (of the besieger). If the result (the same roll than
for the siegework, but with different modifiers) is smaller than the
length of LoS then siege attrition occur (basically as regular attrition
but with slightly different modifiers, eg -SIEGE instead of -MAN).

Remark: when moving, the attrition result 'P' is usually quite
interesting and become a pillage far away from the battle area
(typically at home since it will be removed before income). During
siege, pillaging the province gives malus to the following attrition
rolls which can quickly cause disasters...

Remark 2: If besieging far away from home, the LoS can get pretty
big. At the end of a siege (eg with 2 "siegework +" counters), it is
well possible to have modifiers such that the die roll can give both a
surrender of the fortress (or a breach) *and* a siege attrition...


For assault, it's basically as battle but with only one day, ie one Fire
and one Shock.
DRM are simpler (see table). Besieged do not use the same column (for
losses) if the assault follows a breach (far less losses caused in case
of breach). Besieger win if he causes as many losses as the fortress
level (less in case of breach, see table) with a malus if attacking with
less than 8LD and (cumulative) a bonus for large armies (POL/RUS/TUR) or
if he causes the fortress to rout (may happen in the early game,
especially when Fire causes moral losses but few actual losses).



That's all folks !
