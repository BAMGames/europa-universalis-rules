## History of Cologne

Interesting case study: Cologne is one of the main cities of the
Hanseatic League, an electorate, and a duchy (united with Berg/Cleves).
The electorate ended up controlled by the Duke of Westfalia, a Catholic,
after a religious war (prelude to TYW).

Timeline of Köln archbishopric:
Timeline of Jülich:

The case of the City of Cologne is easy: this is an Hanseatic Kontor as
long as it is not destroyed. It will be if Hansa is destroyed. As long
as the Kontor is there, the territory is only useful as strategic point
(no income).

## History of Palatinate

Palatinate is in fact up to four lines:

 * Duchy of Zweibrücken
 * Palatinate of the Rhine
 * Palatinate Neuburg
 * Palatinate Sulzbach

These lines are cousin to the Bavarian lines of the Wittelsbach, and
indeed in 1799, all territories became Bavarian (well, sort of: the
*Palatinate province* aka *Pfalz*, on the left bank of the Rhine, was
French by that time).

The first line went on as kings of Sweden, but dominated few other
territories. Waged the Landshut War of Succession over the Electoral
Palatinate. Besides giving a claim of Sweden on Bavaria, nothing much.

The second line became extinct in 1685. It converted in 1559 (end of
pII) to protestantism, and probably represents best the *Palatinate
minor*. It became extinct in 1685 (T40). Fragmented territory,
mostly Mannheim.

The third line joined the Protestant in 1608. However, it remained
strictly neutral. Mainly noted for inheriting Jülich and Cleves (aka
province of *Köln*) just before TYW, it remained strictly neutral during
TYW. It was merged with the fourth in 1742 (T51) and Bavaria in 1777
(T58). This should intervene in the *War of Bavarian Succession*.

The fourth line had not many powers, but finally received all others,
including Bavaria, and started the *War of Bavarian Succession*.

### Event: Extinction of Palatinate
This event (hist. turn 40) gives *Pfalz* to Bavaria. Palatinate is no
more. If *OberPfalz* still belonged to Pfalz, then the resulting Bavaria
is neutral (and amend event *War of Bavarian Succession*, maybe). The resulting
country has 3 A counters.

### Event: War of Bavarian Succession
Historic setting: Bavaria has now merged with Palatinate and
Köln. Prussia and Saxony are against *Bavaria province* being given to
Austria (in exchange for Belgian provinces, originally, but it could
have been anything that allowed the ruler of Bavaria to give territories
to his illegitimate heirs.

Win for AUS: Bavaria annexed, Palatinate reinstated in full force
(OberPfalz+Pfalz+Köln+2 A). Possibility to exchange provinces of AUS in
Belgium against provinces of Palatinate. The Bavarian A is fully usable
by AUS.

Win for PRU: Statu quo, possibly gaining one province over one of the
belligerants.

Medium (historical): Bavaria and Palatinate united, nothing gained by
AUS nor by PRU. Basic forces low (strictly lower than the sum of
Palatinate and Bavaria, at least).

Historically, FRA chose to abandon AUS, ANG would have helped PRU but
was busy somewhere else, and RUS was not willing to overcommit in Europe
this time.
