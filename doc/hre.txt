## History of Cologne

Interesting case study: Cologne is one of the main cities of the
Hanseatic League, an electorate, and a duchy (united with Berg/Cleves).
The electorate ended up controlled by the Duke of Westfalia, a Catholic,
after a religious war (prelude to TYW).

### Timeline of the archbishopric

1582: The elector tries to secularize the electorate and to go
Protestant at the same time. Armed intervention of Spain (including
Farnese), Italian mercenaries and Bavaria.

From that time, the fate of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster is merged
with the fate of the Archbishopric.

### Timeline of Jülich

The duchy is united with Berg and Cleve at the beginning of pII (1521),
and allied before. So the *Köln* province should in fact belong to Berg.

### The Cologne city

The case of the City of Cologne is easy: this is an Hanseatic Kontor as
long as it is not destroyed. It will be if Hansa is destroyed. As long
as the Kontor is there, the territory is only useful as strategic point
(no income).

### Event: War of the Jülich succession

This event may degenerate in TYW.  This is a religious civil
war. Authorized to intervene: pretty much everyone? HOL, FRA, ANG, AUS,
SPA, Bavaria, Palatinate, Brandenburg, Münster, Hesse, etc.

Historically, HOL, Brandenburg, ANG, Protestant Union against SPA,
Catholic League against AUS.

TODO.

 * Statu quo: partition of Berg in two provinces, the minor
   Archbishopric of Köln gets territory (usual minor
   now).^[Design note: this reflects the fact that the Duchy would have fallen in the hands of two Wittelbach lines and would have been allied. This avoids creating a minor that owns just the Jülich territory with no power.]
 * Win for protestant: Berg remains intact (and that is one more
   Protestant province for the Protestant Union).
 * Win for Catholic League (historical result): partition of Berg in two
   provinces, Münster becomes Catholic and gets the *Köln* province.
 * Win for AUS: The Duchy of Jülich is annexed by AUS.

### Event: Conversion of the Archbishop of Köln

This is a religious civil war. Authorized to intervene: HOL, AUS?, SPA,
Bavaria (as a minor), Palatinate (as a minor).

Roll 1d10 on this table:
1-2: Not coming
3-4: LD G
5-7: A- G
8-9: A- LD G
10+: A+ G

Add +3 for Bavaria, +1 for Palatinate if Palatinate is not at war. No
reinforcement roll. 50 D$ will by a +1 for Bavaria/Palatinate. The
General is considered rank A and may command allied troops.

A forteress level 2 is placed in the *Köln* province.

Win: The controller of *Köln* province and the new Fortress is the same,
and the Fortress is level 2 (HOL/Palatinate) or level 1 (SPA/Bavaria) at
the end of the turn wins.

Statu quo: Any other solution.

SPA and HOL intervene as they see fit. 

Free passage granted in the HRE for the course of
the war.  The Emperor has to intervene.

  * HOL/Palatinate wins: The Archbishopric becomes
    protestant. Archbishopric goes to MA (unless already better) of HOL
    if HOL did intervene, else neutral.
  * Statu quo: The Archbishopric is neutral, and may vote for anyone.
    Archbishopric goes to neutral.
  * SPA/Bavaria wins: The Archbishopric remains catholic (historical:
    Ernst of Bavaria, also Duke of Westfalia, becomes Archbishop).
    Archbishopric goes to MA (unless already better) of SPA
    if HOL did intervene, else goes to MA (unless already better) of
    AUS (if major), else goes to neutral.

## History of Palatinate

Palatinate is in fact up to four lines:

 * Duchy of Zweibrücken
 * Palatinate of the Rhine
 * Palatinate Neuburg
 * Palatinate Sulzbach

These lines are cousin to the Bavarian lines of the Wittelsbach, and
indeed in 1799, all territories became Bavarian (well, sort of: the
*Palatinate province* aka *Pfalz*, on the left bank of the Rhine, was
French by that time).

The first line went on as kings of Sweden, but dominated few other
territories. Waged the Landshut War of Succession over the Electoral
Palatinate. Besides giving a claim of Sweden on Bavaria, nothing much.

The second line became extinct in 1685. It converted in 1559 (end of
pII) to protestantism, and probably represents best the *Palatinate
minor*. It became extinct in 1685 (T40). Fragmented territory,
mostly Mannheim.

The third line joined the Protestant in 1608. However, it remained
strictly neutral. Mainly noted for inheriting Jülich and Cleves (aka
province of *Köln*) just before TYW, it remained strictly neutral during
TYW. It was merged with the fourth in 1742 (T51) and Bavaria in 1777
(T58). This should intervene in the *War of Bavarian Succession*.

The fourth line had not many powers, but finally received all others,
including Bavaria, and started the *War of Bavarian Succession*.

### Event: Extinction of Palatinate
This event (hist. turn 40) gives *Pfalz* to Bavaria. Palatinate is no
more. If *OberPfalz* still belonged to Pfalz, then the resulting Bavaria
is neutral (and amend event *War of Bavarian Succession*, maybe). The resulting
country has 3 A counters.

### Event: War of Bavarian Succession
Historic setting: Bavaria has now merged with Palatinate and
Köln. Prussia and Saxony are against *Bavaria province* being given to
Austria (in exchange for Belgian provinces, originally, but it could
have been anything that allowed the ruler of Bavaria to give territories
to his illegitimate heirs.

Win for AUS: Bavaria annexed, Palatinate reinstated in full force
(OberPfalz+Pfalz+Köln+2 A). Possibility to exchange provinces of AUS in
Belgium against provinces of Palatinate. The Bavarian A is fully usable
by AUS.

Win for PRU: Statu quo, possibly gaining one province over one of the
belligerants.

Medium (historical): Bavaria and Palatinate united, nothing gained by
AUS nor by PRU. Basic forces low (strictly lower than the sum of
Palatinate and Bavaria, at least).

Historically, FRA chose to abandon AUS, ANG would have helped PRU but
was busy somewhere else, and RUS was not willing to overcommit in Europe
this time.

## History of Trier

The Archbishopric of Trier mostly had a territorial base. As such, it
was run over and the city pillaged several times over the period (mostly
by French, but also by Englishmen chasing French). Except for being run
over, no noticeable facts. It was catholic, but the Sponheim county,
part of the *Trier* province, was protestant (on the border of the
Palatinate).

## History of Mainz

The territory of Mainz was very fragmented (from Erfurt to Mainz, and,
in fact, very little territory around Mainz). Most of it is more or less
the eastern half of the current province. Many losses incurred during
the reformation, compensated (partially) during the TYW. No military
action beyond being burned once, apparently.

## History of Thuringia and Saxony
Thuringia mostly occupies the Ernestine Saxony, and the rest is the
Albertine Saxony. If the provinces are modified as proposed, *Anhalt*
province is more or less historical Anhalt plus the Ernestine lands
given to the Albertine branch after the capitulation of Wittenberg.

# Rules proposal

## Delocalized Archbishoprics

The Minor countries **Archbishopric of Cologne** and **Archbishopric of
Mainz** may not deserve a territorial implantation. The **Archbishopric
of Trier** was run over a sufficient number of times to deserve a place
(for being run over).

These Minor countries cannot be warred against, but they do have no
military counters. They have an income of 4, to be used for all purposes
(e.g. vassalization). A specific declaration of war may be done to
include a fortress for them (the fortress of level 2 will be placed in
the *Köln* province or in the *Mainz* province). Reducing this fortress
to level 1 will pillage the minor for 2 turns (at which point the
fortress is removed from the map until the end of the war).

The LD usually dedicated to these minors should be redistributed on
other minor countries of the HRE.

## Notes on geography

### Around Saxony

Altmark should go a bit below and along the river. Slezsko should end up
almost touching Neumark (but we do not want contact). Lausitz is smaller
and rounder. Anhalt should touch Oberpfalz (and not Sachsen touch
Thüringen)
