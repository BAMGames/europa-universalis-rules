//// Deletion of the ≤6 column for Conquistadors
Date: 2007-01-22 (more or less)
Question: Is the ≤6 modifier for Conquistadors useful?
Currently selected: Alternative 1
Alternative 1: Yes, because they are too weak for a full effect!
Rationale for 1: It is what was done before (more or less).
Alternative 2: Are you kidding me? Only Rising (SUE) matches!
Rationale for 2: Less modifiers!
Patch for 2: not written (easy)


//// Progression of trade levels lost to piracy
Date: 2012-02-20
Question: when levels of trade are lost, they come back at 1/turn rate.
Currently selected: Alternative 2
Alternative 1: Come back at rate 1/turn whatever the levels.
Rationale for 1: It is what was done before.
Alternative 2: Come back at rate 2/turn for levels 5/6.
Rationale for 2: Bigger trade fleets should not suffer that much time
 from a single period of piracy, especially compared to smaller fleets.

 \aparag As piracy losses of commercial fleets is only temporary, each player
 gains 1 level of commercial fleet in each \STZ/\CTZ where its \terme{current
   level} is not the same as the \terme{maximum level}.

//// Independent Navarra
Date: 2007-01-13
Question: Independent Navarra in period I
Currently selected: Alternative 1
Alternative 1: No.
Rationale for 1: It is what was done before.
Alternative 2: Navarra is now a minor with 2 provinces: Bearn and
 Navarra, still national provinces of FRA/ESP (thus CB). At the end of
 each turn during which one of its province is occupied, Navarra is
 effectively dissolved (it signs a mandatory peace ceding all its
 occupied provinces to their respective occupiers; remaining province
 going to the other country). After Dynastic action C-5 (to be created)
 is played, SPA annexes the whole country if on its track. If it is
 period II, Navarra is a vassal of FRA and at peace, FRA annexes the
 whole country at the diplomatic phase (permanently).
Rationale for 2: More infights between SPA and FRA. Possibility of
 fights in Navarra without broadening the wars in Italy (separate wars).
Problems for 2: May be linked to a new League of Cambrai Event.

//// Pioneering
Date: 2012-02-20
Question: When can colonies exceed level 2 or 1
Currently selected: Alternative 1 except for the map (already for Alt. 2)
Alternative 1: Description in terms of exploitable resources, with
 exceptions lurking.
Rationale for 1: This is what was done.
Problems for 1: Impossible to put Fur resources in MISSISSIPI, KANSAS,
 ILLINOIS; not really necessary PA in CAROLINA instead of expected
 Furs. Difficult to adjust the rule for Cotton exploitation.
Alternative 2: Restriction to wait for period V everywhere but gold
 mines. Restriction to further advance on non-coastal provinces:
 Mission/COL(+) required in same or adjacent area for going above level
 2. Thus, slower progression inside America. Should not affect many
 other plans, since COL rarely should exceed level 2 in the beginning.
Rationale for 2: Better modelization of inland progression, esp. for
 French and English. More streamlined rules. Protects against too early
 instalment in United States. Spaniards still can do thanks to missions,
 French and English must slowly accumulate critical mass before
 expanding. The old "exploitable resources" rule in fact only mattered
 for Mississipi and Brasil. This allows for a better modelisation of Fur
 resources in America. All rush of colonists or colonial dynamism lift
 these restrictions. The former various exceptions can be dealt with by
 using the Colonial Dynamisms events (all upgraded to lifting these
 restrictions).
Problems for 2: Transforming a TP in a COL also lifts (temporarily) the
 restriction. To be mentionned somewhere.

//// Fur trade
Date: 2012-02-20
Question: Fur trade -- better modelisation
Alternative 1: current situation: TP exploits 2 Fur/level, COL exploits
 ∞ Fur/level. Each COL(+) reduces available Furs by one.
Rationale for 1: This is what was done.
Alternative 2: Same as alt. 1, but unexploited Furs are exploited by
 forts on a first-built first-served basis (1 per fort max) if there is
 \COL\faceplus or a Mission in the same Area or an adjacent Area.
Rationale for 2: The string of forts in America by French settlers
 can be explained by the desire to exploit the (new) Fur resources in
 Illinois, Kansas and Mississipi (sources of many furs). This constrains
 French or English player to send military troops for exploration there,
 rivalry can actually happen without requiring a non-historic TP there
 (if we want TP to simulate this, that makes too many TPs that could be
 used in India or Africa instead). Allows exploitation of Amazonia.

//// Russia in Kexholm
Date: 2011-06-01 (approx)
Question: Russia initially owned Kexholm, and conquered Neva and Kexholm
 during Ingrian War (Times of Trouble in Russia)
Alternative 1: Russia does not own it (simplification).
Rationale for 1: Simple enough.
Alternative 2: Russia owns it. ToT lets Sweden get one non-national
 province, plus one national province if there is one owned by Russia.
Rationale for 2: historical, but it makes the description of the ToT
 event a bit too powerful if it is annexation of 2 provinces. By
 favoring the Swedish-Russia agreement, it avoids the POL+SWE against
 RUS in early period III to get Neva, then again during ToT to make POL
 stronger against Russia (no help from Sweden).
Alternative 3: Kexholm initially Russian.
Rationale for 3: See Alternative 2.
Problems for 3: Too powerful for Russia, Neva will never be back to
 Sweden.
Alternative 4: Put a Russian Presidio in Kexholm.
Rationale for 4: More balanced, easier to defeat for Sweden.
Problems for 4: A LAND Praesidio? I do not like that.
