# Major Denmark in periods I and II

## Why the Denmark?

This is an alternate solution to playing Austria as a full-length player
and having the switch Venice-Holland. This has not been completely
thought through, but some ideas to make it playable are given.  The
transition from Denmark to Holland is quite natural. They are protestant
power, and on the same side in the Thirty Years war. What is not
natural, is having Denmark stop being a MAJ when it becomes quite
interesting.

Interactions can be found with three countries: England, Russia, Poland
and Spain/Austria. This is as much as one can get in period I and
II. Currently, only one event concerns this country in the considered
period (end of the Union of Kalmar, pII, historically 1523, stemming
from a bloodbath in 1520, exactly the beginning of period II).

As a player, DAN will get to test a bit of colonisation (mostly static;
developing already existing COL), a bit of trade, a few wars, and a
civil war. This makes DAN a perfect seat for beginners (which will then
graduate to HOL).

## A brief history of Denmark in periods I and II

For a few decades, the relation between Sweden and Denmark has been on
and off. Since the 1450s, they remain united in the Kalmar Union but
struggling for dominance. The king is John II from 1481 to 1513. He
restored the full union of Kalmar (very briefly), then loses it (after a
large defeat in Slesvig against peasants), then regains it on paper,
then wars against it again. In the course of the wars against Sweden, he
briefly allied himself with Russia, Scots and French mercenaries. He
fought Lübeck, which he pillaged, and Bremen (both cities belong to the
Hanseatic League, as well as Hamburg). When he dies, Christian II "the
Tyrant" takes his place. In 1520, Sweden is finally defeated. Little
time later, Christian II kills a host of nobles from Sweden, and is
deposed in 1523. By the way, he was married to the daughter of the
Archiduke of Austria (and later brother-in-law to the Emperor). He was
attempting to establish absolutism at the times (and failed).

The Union of Kalmar will never be reconstituted. Frederick of Holstein,
brother of John II, takes the crown of a Denmark without Sweden (Norway
has been annexed formally in 1536 only). Frederick I of Denmark had to
suppress a large-scale revolt (revolts and attempt of invasion by
Spanish-paid forces from Holland lead by the former King, followed by
greedy Hanseatic and Catholic Danish forces). The end of this civil war
(the Count's feud) is won by his son Christian III and Johann
Rantzau. After that, Christian III completed the Reformation process.

Later, fearing aggression from Charles V (of Austria), he signed the
peace treaty of Speyer, and Denmark remained quiet till the Livonian War
(in period III), especially passing on the league of Schmalkade. The
last act of Denmark is to acquire the islands west of Estonia
(Osel-Wiek) and regain the control of Slesvig.

The period III begins actively with the Livonian War (Denmark intervenes
to protect the Livonian orders, which makes Sweden angry).

# A gamewise history of Denmark

## Turn by turn

 * T1: Russia declares war to Hansa, Sweden involved in the war, allied
   to Denmark. Novgorod Kontor destroyed, some pillages, Sweden vanquished
   in 1497 by Denmark.

 * T2: end of the War.

 * T3 (or T2?): Trying to annex Dithmarshen (Slesvig Hansa
   Kontor). Major defeat against Hansa. SUE in dissidence again.

 * T4: 1507: revolts in Norway for secession (future Christian
   II). Nothing very important (money making!)

 * T5: 1510: War against Sweden & Lubeck due to commercial treaty with
   England. Statu Quo with Sweden, naval victories against Hansa.

 * T6: War against Sweden (again). Sweden defeated (maybe the same war?)
   and in Kalmar Union. End of period I.

 * T7: End of Kalmar Union: Stockholm bloodbath. Christian II destituted
   (short war before, or is it the war in T6? Or yet another
   war?). Gustav Vasa takes back Sweden and is elected King of
   Sweden. Frederick I is elected king of Denmark. Hansa comes to the
   rescue (not many details currently on this). This is an EVENT.

 * T8: Money! (or something else).

 * T9: The count's feud (first turn of Danish Civil war). Some Catholics
    try to revive the exiled Christian II (responsible of the end of
    Kalmar Union). German mercenaries are lead by Danish nobles. This is
    an EVENT.

 * T10: End of the Count's feud. 1536: Only Malmö and Kopenhagen still
    hold. Christian III has them surrender. (Rantzau, already there,
    against Count Christopher)

 * T11: DAN (menaces to?) intervenes in a SPA/FRA war. Small revolt in
     Norway. Treaty of Speyer, ending activity of Christian III in
     conflicts against SPA (no efforts of SPA against Luthereanism in
     DAN, and reciprocally).

 * T12-T13: peace.

 * T14: Retake of Slesvig territory (Hanseatic Kontor).

## Sources of income

Under Kalmar Union:

  * Basic income: 24, plus External trade (60-90)
  * Fish: about 20
  * income of Sweden-Finland is 45/30/15/0 according to the diplomatic
status of the Union. It counts as land income.
  * income of Norway is as usual and counts as Vassal income (4+3+25=32).

Do not forget the Sund taxes, Hansa ransoms (in the end), trade income.
Of course, most of this is not compatible with a strong-Hansa strategy.

## Objectives (possibilities)

### Period I

1. Commercial Monopoly in Baltic at least one turn (40)

2. SUE forced into the Kalmar Union by war or 3 turns in Strong Union (each
time: 25, max 50) M

3. Expand Kalmar Union number of provinces (25 per province, max 50)[^prov]

4. Fish monopoly (4 turns out of 6) (30)

5. Colony established in America (25)

[^prov] There are not that many provinces annexable around Denmark. One
way to fulfil objective 3 could be to preempt some territory in Livonia
(before period III, historic). Another way would be to grab land on the
south Baltic shore (hard). A last way may be to build a level 6 colony
(transforming Iceland in an almost European zone).

### Period II

1. DAN protestant M E (40)

2. Winner in the end of Kalmar Union, NOR annexed (25 each)

3. Schmalkaldic league not dissolved (40 E)

4. Three monopolies (5 turns out of 8) (30)

5. \TP established in America (30)


# New mechanisms

## Area Groenland and Danish colonisation

A new area Groenland is created with 2 provinces (Iceland+Groenland)
(1/9/-) in mountains, double Cold, Fish*5 with a special rule (see
below). There are no natives.

In 1492, DAN owns the colony Reykjavik in Iceland, which is level 1 in
1492^[A large plague had happened in 1494] and exploits 2 Fish. Danish
colonization malus is 0.

DAN has 2 COL counters and 1 TP. DAN has 1 TP/COL implementation every
even turn.

The Fish resources of the Groenland area are diminished by the Fish
Manufactures of England and Holland and the second side of France (down
to 0 if needed).

## Hansa

### Kontors

Hansa has Kontors counters. I am thinking of the current list:

Baltic Kontors:

 * Novgorod
 * Skåne (two Kontors)
 * Danzig
 * Livonija
 * Hinterpommern
 * Vorpommern

North Sea Kontors:

 * Vlaanderen
 * Oldenburg
 * Vestfold (historically, remained very late)
 * Köln
 * Slesvig (in fact the Dithmarshen republic)

The two groups of Kontors fix the reference value of the Hansa Trading
Fleets in the Mer Baltique and Mer du Nord STZ.

Start level: 5 and 5. Adjust levels of Holland to 3 in Baltic and 0 for
Sweden (reference 3), Holland to 3 in North Sea.

Removing a Kontor is done by

1. being at war with Hansa.
2. Attacking or besieging a fortress of level 1 with 1 LD inside.

or

1. Annexing a province with a Kontor in it (at your choice).

The Kontor in Skåne is "recreated" as soon as it is destroyed (strong
implantation of the Guild) and counts for two (for one after having been
destroyed).

 * Strength of Hansa: 3 LD/ND+1 LD/ND if A+1 LD/ND if F
 * Basic Force: 1 LD/ND+1 LD if A+1 ND if F.

Hansa gains a A counter and 1 ND of basic forces if it masters the
Baltic or the North sea (reference level > 3 in these STZ), and 1 F
counter if it masters both.

Each Kontor brings to the Hansa the income of the province and removes
it from the province.

The Kontor acts as a fortress of level 1 for Hansa troops only if the
Hansa does not control the province in which the Kontor is. The militia
inside the fortress cannot leave the province.

Kontor can be reinforced by using 1 f (not above level 3 however)
(two sided-counters)

### Alliance with Sweden

Sweden is part of the Hansa and have a reciprocal defensive alliance
with them. It will call DAN for help (if DAN is not the attacker). DAN
must comply or lose 1 stab (unless Sweden was in Dissidence).

## Union of Kalmar

### Sweden
Sweden can be in one of four states:

 * Strong union,
 * Weak union,
 * Dissidence,
 * Open Rebellion

History: after roll: O/S/W/D/O/D/S (end, because of end of Union)

Every turn, during the event phase, a roll can be made if Sweden and DAN
are not at war with each other:[^designnote1]

 * -2 if had a major defeat preceding turn
 * -2 if HAB or Prima Hollandia not allied to DAN
 * -4 if HANSA not allied to DAN
 * +2 if Kalmar union is Strong
 * +DIP of the monarch
 * +1 for Sweden
 * +1d10-2d10
 * 0/+2/+5 (20D$/50$/100D$)

The result is as follows (even if no roll is made, see below):
 * 0-4 (or blank peace): goes to Weak union (or remains Strong)
 * 5+ (or favourable peace): goes to strong
 * <0 (or no roll): loses one level

In period II, if Sweden is dissident or in rebellion a second time in a
row, apply End of Kalmar Union in period II.

If the preceding turn ended in a peace between DAN and Sweden, Sweden
will go to Strong union for 1 peace condition (and no roll is
needed). In case of a blank peace, it goes back to weak union (but a
roll has to be made).

[^designnote1]: The usual modifier is thus -6+1+6 (no HAB nor HANSA),
thus +1 under John I, and +0 under Christian II. Major defeat is a -2,
already strong is a +2. That means Christian II with weak investment has
12%/1% of progress. Here is the list of modifiers: -3:3.5%:0.0% /
-2:5.6%:0.1% / -1:8.4%:0.4% / 0:12.0%:1.0% / 1:16.5%:2.0% / 2:22.0%:3.5%
/ 3:28.3%:5.6% / 4:35.2%:8.4% / 5:42.5%:12.0% / 6:50.0%:16.5% /
7:57.5%:22.0% / 8:64.8%:28.3%


### Norway

A similar roll is made for Norway, but more simple:[^designnote2]

 * +2 if Kalmar union is Strong
 * +2 if the "Close ties" condition was acquired
 * +2 if "Happy parliament" on preceding turn
 * +1d10
 * +0/2/5 (20D$/50$/100D$)

The result is as follows:

 * 4-11: gains one level
 * 12-13: gains one level+"Happy Parliament"
 * 14+: annexation of Norway
 * <4: loses one level
 * no roll=status quo

[^designnote2]: The usual modifier when weak is +0. Thus, the chances
with a weak investment is roughly 10% to get a Happy Parliament, 10% to
get a Dissident Norway, and 80% to go back to Strong. When Strong, two
10 in a row will get Norway in full Annexation.

### Effects of the situation

 * SUE/NOR strong: Answers the call, but union becomes weak next turn.
 * SUE/NOR weak: Answers the call, but union goes to Dissidence next
 turn.
 * SUE/NOR in Dissidence: Does not answer the call with A (only with
 LDs). Free CB for DAN to declare war upon to reestablish Union (the
 first condition of peace always must be getting SUE/NOR in Strong
 union).

During wars, these actions (not diplomatic) can be done to improve
status (if the countries are on the same side).

No exchange of provinces can happen between Sweden, Norway and Denmark
before the end of the Union of Kalmar.

### Conquest and the Union of Kalmar

Provinces of "Livonia" (from Memel to Neva) and in Finnish/Russian
territory MUST be given (if won) to SUE while in Union of Kalmar ; they
grant immediate Strong Union for the turn (like if a favourable peace
were just signed).

Provinces of Scotia must be given to Norway and grant immediate merging
of the kingdoms with Norway Army kept.

Other provinces go to Denmark.

# Modifications to Dania
 
## Initial situation

Trøndelag switches to 3.
DAN owns Västergotland, Skåne, Oldenburg, Gotland+current national territory.
Norway owns Jämtland (5).
Kontors in Danish territory: Slesvig (4), Oldenburg (3), Skåne (5).

Colonies: Godthåb;Reykjavík
Trading-Post: Vinland

Level 0 in Baltic, level 1 in North Sea.

If the projected rule on military occupation is available, DAN has a one
military occupation usable only in the HRE.

## Period 3 transition

DAN automatically goes to Protestantism (even if returned by SPA), and
annexation of Norway becomes effective.

## Military forces

The recruitment area of DAN is owned provinces in Danish, Norwegian
(after annexation of Norway) and Swedish national territory.

DAN has two armies, plus the Norwegian army that can get supply only
from Norway.

DAN uses the Norvegia forces when calling Norway for help. It has
ARMY(-) of basic (veteran) forces, everything else has to be paid for
(and maintained).

## Trade fleets

 * Actions of HOL: The number of TF increase is given by a roll: 1-2
none; 3-5 one; 6-8 two; 9-10 three levels. DAN makes the 1st, SPA the
2nd, DAN the rest.
 * DAN gets one TFI per turn, begins at 2/2 (limits of 3/3).

## Leaders

### Kings of Denmark

John I: 7/6/7 (death test as normal, scheduled.
Christian II: 8/5/8 starts in turn 5 or earlier, general 3.3.3.
Frederick I (and maybe others): random.
Christian III: 8/5/7, general 4.3.3, 7 turns, 3 turns without death test.

### Søren Norby

Norby (Søren): Most faithful companion of Christian II, fought many wars
against Sweden and Lübeck.

Amiral A 4.4.3 / Explorer 4.2.2. T 5-8.
(no *; choose at beginning of turn)

### Johann Rantzau
This is the uncle of Daniel Rantzau (the one of the wars in Livonia).

Rantzau (Johann): Military commander under Frederick I and Christian
III, he lead the Danish armies to victory in the Danish Civil War.

General A 5.3.3 -1 appears by event End of Kalmar Union (after
it). Lasts up till turn 14 (included).


### Gustav Vasa

Gustav Vasa: Swedish General A 6.4.4, appears by event End of Kalmar
Union, till turn 14 (included).


## Provinces

### Iceland and Greenland

Initially Reykjavik is level 1 (there was a plague in 1494) and
Groenland is known. See above.

### Holstein

 * T1: Dominated by Hansa (Hamburg)? Owned by Dania?
 * T34: Ceded to Sweden (independent Schleswig-Holstein).
 * T46: More or less independent (see Great Northern War).
 * T57: Returned to Dania by Russia (received by inheritance, Paul I).

Could be summed up as: interest of Dania for it, owned by Hansa, taken
by Sweden, GNW gives it to Dania.

### Schleswig

 * T1: Military control of Hansa (Dithmarschen independent peasant republic)
 * T3: John I of Denmark gets a major defeat against Dithmarshen,
   triggering Sweden war in T4.
 * T14 (1559): Denmark retakes Schleswig.
 * T34: Ceded to Sweden (independant Schleswig-Holstein).
 * T43: Great Northern War, invaded by Dania (again).
 * T45: Great Northern War, invaded by Dania.
 * T46: Annexed by Dania.

Could be summed up as: owned by DAN*, military control by Hansa if DAN
major, taken by DAN, ceded to Sweden, reconquered by Denmark.
Note: in event VI-1 (Great northern war), the truce in α-F.1.c should be
only two turns.

### Ösel

 * T14/15: 1559: sold to Denmark (->Magnus) (part of Fall of the Teutonic)
 * T16: 1572: direct administration by DAN (ignore)
 * T31: Annexed by SUE (Torstenson's war)
 * T47: Annexed by RUS

This province should have income 2 and be a praesido over Livonija
(fortress level 1).

### Jämtland

 * T31: Annexed by SUE (Torstenson's war)

Currently large revenue because of gold mine. During the unrest period
in Jämtland's history (1563–1677) it shifted alignment between the two
states no less than 13 times. Initially Norwegian.

Bergslagen is where the mines are. Two mines could be put there.

# Events

## End of Kalmar Union

Summary: Sweden leaves the dominion of Denmark
Aftermath: Splitting provinces between Denmark and Sweden.

### Historical version

The leader Gustav Vasa begins in Bergslagen, with 2LD. It fights DAN
forces, goes to Svealand, fights DAN forces, goes to Bergslagen, gets
reinforcements, fights local forces, goes to Gästrikland, sieges local
city (Uppsala), goes to Småland, waits for naval forces from the Hansa,
fights local forces, sieges Kalmar, goes to Svealand, sieges
Stockholm. End of game for Denmark.

### Setup

If this is not period II, do not mark and reroll. If Sweden is not at
peace, it signs an automatic white peace with the opposite side (there
are no more any rulers to deal with in Stockholm). If DAN is not at
peace, it can propose a white peace to its enemies, but they do not have
to accept.

This is a Civil war (not a religious war).

Sweden receives its basic forces: Gustav Vasa (G A 6.4.4), A-, LD and
F-. The army will appear in the province of its choice at the first
round of Sweden move. A reinforcement roll for Sweden is rolled but the
forces are kept by its controller for the first "call to peasants". The
fleet will appear in the Baltic sea at any moment (Lübeck intervention).
The modifier of the reinforcements is +2.

Denmark forces are reduced to its basic forces. Admiral Norby goes away,
and Pirate(-) is put in Baltic.

Denmark receives the control of some provinces and the cities therein:
 * Svealand
 * If the Union was weak or better, it receives also Småland or
   Västergotland (if the Union was in Dissidence, control the province
   but not the city)
 * If the Union was strong, it also receives Gästrikland.

The controller of Sweden decides whether the Swedish fortresses are
maintained or not.

Denmark may call upon Norway to intervene in this war, but only in
defensive attitude.

### Subsequent turns

A roll on the reinforcement table with the +1 modifier in offensive
attitude is offered.

The controller of Sweden may also ask again the generosity of the
Hanseatic cities for a F-, but loses 15 PV by doing so.

### Diplomacy

DAN may abandon the Union of Kalmar willingly. Sweden then owns all of
its national territory excluding Skåne, but including Västergotland,
Jämtland and Gotland. The "Close ties" effect is not given. DAN loses
20VP.

### War

If Gustav Vasa dies, a member of its family takes his place (use the
same counter). If Gustav Vasa is captured, this will call for a ransom
at the end of the war, but a member of its family takes his place
anyway (only one ransom maximum).

After each province taken in Swedish National Territory (including Skåne
and Västergotland), Sweden may make a "call to peasants", winning some
more troops. The first "call to peasants" can be done after any battle
(with the troops gathered in the reinforcement). Subsequent "call to
peasants" can bring one of the following things:

 * A roll on the reinforcement table at +1 in offensive attitude
 * A roll on the reinforcement table at -1 in naval attitude
 * One G (from the pool of Swedish generals)

### Peace

At the end of each turn, DAN may claim the end of the Kalmar Union (and
make peace). The controller of Sweden may also claim the end of the
Kalmar Union if it is POR or if no Swedish National Territory (except
Gotland and Finland) is controlled by DAN.

The end of the Union entails the following effects :

 * DAN receives Johann Rantzau (G A 5.3.3 -1).
 * Norway is put in Dissidence
 * Sweden gets all its national territory except for Gotland, Jämtland,
   Skåne, Västergotland, Småland
 * DAN gets these provinces except for the one chosen at start.
 * For each two different cities controlled at some point by DAN and not
   taken in the Swedish National territory (Gotland counts, Stockholm
   counts twice, Finland does not count) at the peace, Denmark may claim
   one of the following:

    * Claim the "Close ties" (and put Norway in Weak Union instead)
    * Destroy all Kontors in Skåne
    * 15 VP
    * Keep trade fleets in Baltic (else 3 levels are lost)

 * For each two different cities controlled at some point by Denmark
   taken by Sweden, the controller of Sweden may claim for Sweden (its
   choice):

    * Compensate the Hanseatic league (mandatory first condition) (nothing)
    * Ownership of Jämtland
    * Levies on the Sund (may count as two, if Västergotland not owned).
    * 15 VP
    * Ownership of Gotland
    * 3 levels of TF in Baltic

The province chosen by DAN will be attributed to its owner at the end.

Example (Historical): Sweden took 4 cities in one turn. Denmark was
Strong, but lacked armies. It ended the civil war quickly, keeping still
4 cities (Gotland, Jämtland, Skåne, Västergotland). DAN claimed "Close
ties" and Keep trade fleets, whereas Sweden compensated the Hanseatic
League and took the 3 trade fleet levels. That's the historical.

Example (Strong Sweden): if Sweden starts controlling its own territory
but Svealand and Västergotland (chosen by DAN), it could end up
occupying Svealand, Skåne, Västergotland, Jutland and Slesvig. DAN still
controls Gotland and Småland. DAN gets the "Close ties", and POR could
choose "Compensate the Hanseatic League" and the Levies on the Sund
(since Västergotland was acquired). However, Småland remains acquired to
DAN. Sweden starts with the Sund rights gained compared to the historical.

Example (Strong Denmark): if Sweden takes only two cities (Svealand and
Gästrikland, say), one not being the chosen one, DAN still owns
Västergotland and Småland, can claim the "Close ties", destroy the
Kontors of Skåne and keep its trade fleets in the Baltic. Sweden starts
with only one province missing.

The "close ties" later counts as "claim to the Swedish crown" when SUE is
in play.

These are the only things that can be exchanged by this war. DAN may
also exchange money with participants in the war.

## Count's Feud

Summary: Denmark religious civil war to establish protestantism.
Aftermath: The longest, the more costly. Can provide Spain with an
opportunity to switch back one country to Catholicism.

Cannot happen if End of Kalmar Union has not begun.

This is a religious civil war trying to re-establish Christian II or his
family (Catholic).

The prologue (capture of Christian II) is not simulated.

HANSA will intervene in support of Christian II and represents the rebel
side. It will be played by the Sole Defensor of the Catholic Faith.

 * Count Cristoffer: Hansa General A 4.2.2 (duration of event)
 * Meyer: Hansa General B 4.2.2 (duration of event)

Hansa raises troops on the budget of the SDoCF (with a separate limit
for the quantity of troops). Whatever the reference levels of Hansa, the
A and F counter can be used.

ANG may intervene on the side of its choice.

Saxony may be called upon by the SDoCF, it costs 10 VP. It gives the
right to all parties to cross territories of the Holy Empire.

Independent Sweden can be called upon by DAN, it costs 10 VP. It will
send one A+ commanded by Gustav Vasa.

Three revolts are rolled for in Sjælland, in Jutland and in Skåne. One
is rolled with strength +2 and General Cristoffer is put there. General
Meyer starts in one Hansa-owned province.

If all provinces are in revolt, Denmark loses. Otherwise, the event ends
when all revolts are destroyed.

Rebel side gets reinforcements only if one of the two Generals is alive
and in an Hansa-controlled province. Rebel side has 1 normal campaign
every round, and SDoCF can pay for more expensive types of campaigns.


# Minor Denmark

Minor Denmark needs to be reinforced, because it cannot face Sweden long
enough. However, it is already strong in the beginning. What is needed,
is more stamina, not more forces.

Some ideas:

 * No loss of second ARMY counter after TYW.
 * National revolt like Persia
 * Norwegian Army (with supply only from Norway)
