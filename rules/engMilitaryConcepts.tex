\chapter{Military Concepts}\label{chapter:MilitaryConcepts}

\begin{designnote}
  This Chapter describes the main concepts and common rules used
  during the Military phase, such as stacking limits, handling of
  multi-national stacks, supply, \ldots

  The proper rules are presented in Segment order in the next
  Chapter.
\end{designnote}

\section{Rounds and Impulses}
The military phase is split into several \emph{rounds}. During each round,
alliances all get an \emph{impulse} to play (in decreasing order of
initiative). During its impulse, each alliance plays a number of segments,
similar to the segments of other phases.
