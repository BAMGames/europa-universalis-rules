\chapter{Military Concepts}\label{chapter:MilitaryConcepts}

\begin{designnote}
  This Chapter describes the main concepts and common rules used
  during the Military phase, such as stacking limits, handling of
  multi-national stacks, supply, \ldots

  The proper rules are presented in Segment order in the previous
  Chapter.

  You may probably skip this Chapter during a first reading, it sometimes
  becomes ``precisions for the insanes''.
\end{designnote}

\begin{todo}
  This Chapter is under heavy work. The absence of detailed numbering of rules
  reflects this.

  It is currently mostly reminders of what I need to write here.
