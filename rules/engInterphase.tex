\section{Stability adjustment}\label{chInter:Stability}
\aparag[Effects of ongoing wars]
During a war, at the end of each turn, the \STAB of each participating player
is reduced 1 cumulative level each turn (i.e.. the player loses 1 level on the
first turn, 2 others on the second, 3 on the third and so
on... etc.). However, after 4 consecutive war turns, the loss is limited to -4
levels per turn, and this until the peace is made.
\aparag[Effects of Overseas Wars]
The same reduction of \STAB is applied in Overseas Wars excepted that the loss
is limited to -2 levels per turn.
\aparag[Multiple Wars] If a power is involved in more than one war, only the
hardest lost is applied.
\aparag[Continuing Limited Intervention]
A limited intervention in a war may be continued from one turn to another, but
this costs -1 level in \STAB for the intervening power.

\aparag[Turkey and the Knights]
If \TUR is neither at war, nor Anti-Prosperous, it loses -1 level in \STAB if
the pirate of The \pays{chevaliers} managed to inflict losses on Turkish
commercial fleets.

\aparag[\villeVienne]
If \TUR controls \villeVienne, \HAB (\SPA or \AUS) loses 1 additional level of
\STAB.

\section{Placement of leaders}\label{chInter:Leaders}

\aparag[Ransom of Leaders]
Captured Monarchs are given back at this time.
\bparag For Major Powers, it costs them 2 \STAB and they give 200\ducats to
the ransoming power (this is mandatory).
\bparag For Minor Powers, their Monarch is ransomed against 50\ducats.
\bparag Alternativeley, a ransome Monarch of a minor power can be used at the
Peace Segment, to increases the modifier for Peace by a +2.

\bparag Remove all un-named leaders of Major Powers; leave those of Minor
Powers at war or those on Revolts (but keep all military forces of Minor
