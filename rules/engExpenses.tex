\chapter{Expenses}\label{chapter:Expenses}
\begin{designnote}[Expenses] This chapter describes mainly all the logistics
  (maintenance and purchase of new forces), country management and development
  operations. All of these form the administrative phase, that may be cut into
  three main sections: administrative operations, automatic actions and
  logistics. Administration and Logistic are conducted independently and
  simultaneously by all players while automatic actions resolve the conflicts
  that arise from the new state (incompatible placements of new colonies,
  monopolies, etc.) Most of the parameters of administrative operations were
  explained in~\ref{chapter:ThePowers}, and serve mostly
  in~\ref{chapter:Incomes} and this chapter. The nature of military troops is
  explained here before the logistics details.
\end{designnote}

\begin{playtip}
  The easier way to play the administrative phase is to have all players
  simultaneously compute their income and plan their expenses (both
  administrative and logistic). Once all expenses are planned, players can
  resolve them two by two (one player resolves his action with the other
  watching the die rolls).

  Often, one will find out that planning logistic ahead (prevision for
  campaigns cost, then buying troops and fortresses) has do be done before
  planning administration as military can be the priority expense and
  administration only gets the ``leftover'' money. Of course, this must be
  based only on an estimate of the income, since the exact amount will only be
  known at the end of the turn, after the Exchequer test\ldots

  The most efficient way to plan and resolve actions is to write everything on
  the record sheet: nature of the actions, investment, column and bonus. Thus,
  resolving the action is very fast: simply announce column and bonus and roll
  one die with the other player checking the result in the table. Writing down
  the result of your actions (success, failure, or amount of progression
  gained) will allow to quickly resolve all the actions in a row. Then, you
  can ``release'' the other player and actually implement the results obtained
  (which can require finding the right counter and similar things).
