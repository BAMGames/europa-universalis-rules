\subsection{English intervention in wars}
\aparag \ENG has the possiblity of signing offensive limited alliances in any
war that is neither a Civil War nor a Religious War.
\aparag \ENG may use its \corsaire counters in addition to its forces
involved in limited intervention.
\aparag\label{chSpecific:England:Minors at war} \ENG may use the forces of any
minor country in \VASSAL position on its diplomatic track in a limited
intervention. Those forces are dealt with as if in limited intervention
of a minor country at the side of the alliance supported by \ENG,
excepted that they can not be fully involved in the war by the enemy
unless the enemy alliance first declares war to \ENG.
\aparag During any War, \ENG may announce that he will send forces of a
minor country in \VASSAL position on its diplomatic track in the
\ROTW. This declaration costs {\bf 1} \STAB for each vassal that will be
used, and is valid for the rest of the period. The troops of the vassal
are then used in limited or full intervention with the change that they
can go in the \ROTW (and be supplied there by English fleets or colonial
settlements).
\subsubsection{Military leaders}
% Now the general rule.
%\aparag\label{chSpecific:England:Monck Blake} 
%\leader{Monck} and \leader{Blake} are both generals and admirals.
%However, contrary to the usual rule, their role for the current turn
%is announced at the deployment phase and fixed for the whole turn. 
\aparag\label{rule:RoyalMarines} Royal Marines appear as a general only
during \eventref{pV:WoSS}.
\aparag \leader{Marlborough} does not have the malus of {\bf -1} to its
survival tests in battles (due normally to its '6' values).

\subsection{Overseas and Colonial Policy}
\subsubsection{The Sea Hounds}\label{chSpecific:England:Sea Hounds}
\aparag Admirals (and privateers) \leader{Drake} and \leader{Hawkins},
as well as both Explorers \leader{Cavendish} and \leader{Frobisher} are
the \terme{Sea Hounds}. They have a special mark ``h'' on their counter.
\bparag[Drake] The first time \leader{Drake} is reputed dead due to
battle loss, attrition or exploration, he is in fact unavailable for the
rest of the turn but returns back in play at the beginning of the
following turn.

\aparag[As Privateers]  A \corsaire led by \terme{Sea Hounds} may
attack Convoys or Commercial fleets and/or \COL/\TP of other players, 
or even Loot European provinces, without \ENG having to declare war 
on that player. 
\ENG can however attack only one such player per
turn, and must announce the target country during the military rounds,
at the end of the second round at the latest.
\bparag[Privateer] If commanding a \corsaire unit that was committed to
the attack of commercial fleets not at war, a \terme{Sea Hound} must
stay the rest of the turn with this \corsaire.
\bparag There is no loss of \STAB for England in doing so as there is no
state of war between itself and the attacked country.
\bparag Once the attack is declared the attacked country and its allies
may react with Naval forces (or land forces in \TP/\COL or provinces)
against the units led by the \terme{Sea Hounds}.

\aparag[Exploration with Sea Hounds] \terme{Sea Hounds} with Admiral
symbols may also be used as Explorers for any discoveries to be made by
the English player, including while acting as Privateers.

\subsubsection{English Missionaries and Missions}
\aparag See \ruleref{chSpecific:Missions} for the general rules.
\aparag \ANG obtains one Missionary each even-numbered turn, beginning
with period III. It may use 1 Missionary if \terme{Catholic} or
\terme{Protestant}, and 2 Missionaries if \terme{Anglican}.
\aparag Bonuses given by English Missionaries to \COL/\TP attempts may
be used even on \Faceplus settlements.
\aparag If \terme{Protestant} (including \terme{Anglican}), English
Missions give a malus of {\bf -2} to \COL/\TP placement attempts of any
other power in the same \Area.
\aparag \ANG loses 5\PV each time one of his Missions is destroyed.

\subsubsection{English Sepoys}
\longCipayes{Sepoys}

\aparag[\sectionleader{Clive}] The conquistador \leader{Clive} can use the table of
conquistadors in \continent{India}. Forces stacked with \leader{Clive}
never cause Activation of Natives in \continent{India}.
\bparag If \leader{Clive} is not in play (lost for any reason), the minimum \LeaderC in period VII 
can then  use the table of conquistadors in \continent{India} (or a named one if there is one;
the leader is determined at the beginning of the turn and can not change).

\subsection{\sectionpaysmajeur{Angleterre} in play}
\subsubsection{English Kings, Queens and Ministers}
\aparag[\anchormonarque{Henry VII}] reigns in 1492, with values 7/5/6,
scheduled to die at the beginning of turn 5. His heir is \monarque{Henry
  VIII}.
\aparag[\anchormonarque{Henry VIII}] is the second English king, with
values 6/7/7. His reign is 8 turns long, and he does not test survival
during the first 5 turns. At the end of its reign, apply automatically
\eventrefname{pII:Act Supremacy} as one of the events of the turn.
\aparag[\anchormonarque{Elisabeth I}] arrives through conditions
described in event \eventref{pII:Act Supremacy}. She has values 8/8/6
and her reign will last 8 turns. She does not test survival during the 5
first turns. She cannot be used as a general. During her reign, \ENG
adds a free maintenance of a \FLEET\faceplus and a \corsaire\faceplus.
\aparag[The \anchormonarque{Parliament}.] Because of
\eventref{pIV:English Civil War}, \monarque{Parliament} may rule in
\ENG. It has values 5/8/8 and makes no test of survival. It gives a
bonus of {\bf +2} to the rolls for all administrative actions (except
exceptional taxes, \ruleref{chIncomes:Exceptional Taxes}).
\aparag[\anchormonarque{Cromwell}] may replace the \monarque{Parliament}
following \eventref{pIV:English Civil War}. He has values 8/8/9, is
still a general \leaderdata{Cromwell}.  His Reign is to last the number
of turns remaining for the general (of the initial 5 turns).  He must
test for survival normally. As long as his reign continues, \ENG gains a
free maintenance of one \ARMY\faceplus.
\aparag[\strongmonarque{Willem III} (William III).] Event
\eventref{pV:Glorious Revolution} may put the ruler of \HOL on the
throne of \ENG, if \HOL is ruled by the House of Orange.
\bparag A personal union exists between \HOL and \ENG: that is a
mandatory defensive alliance, and a usual offensive alliance. They make
an immediate mandatory white peace and can not be at war against each
other as long as this lasts. The union ends when the Monarch dies.
\bparag The Monarch from the House of Orange is controlled by \ANG until
the end of \eventref{pV:Glorious Revolution} and by \HOL after. \HOL
makes the survival tests.
\aparag[\anchorministre{Pitt}] may be named minister through
\eventref{pVII:William Pitt}. He has values 9/8/8 and remains a random
number of turns; its values can be used for the next monarch's values
determination if a succession takes place while he is still alive.
