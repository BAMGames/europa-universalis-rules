\event{pVI:Great Northern War}{VI-1}{The Great Northern War}{1}{PBNew}

\history{1700-1721}
\dure{until the end of the war caused by the event.}
% (Jym) All \CB switched from \phevnt -> \phdipl. It looks cleaner to manage
% reactions at diplomacy time due to all \CB... the only difference is
% preventing the signing of alliances, but this does not really matter here
% since there are two turns to use the \CB... (JCD) I am not sure to follow
% this line of reasoning, but in fact, I don't think this matters much.

\phdipl
\aparag[Russian aggression of \SUE] \RUS has a free \CB against \SUE if they
have a common frontier.
\bparag This \CB can be used at this turn or the next one.
\bparag If \RUS does not use this \CB, it loses 2 \STAB at the end of the
diplomacy phase of the next turn. This becomes a loss of 3 \STAB during and
after the reign of \monarque{Peter the Great}.
\aparag[Polish aggression of \SUE] \POLpol has a normal \CB against \SUE if
they have a common frontier.
\bparag This \CB can be used at this turn or the next one.
\bparag \POLpol is affected by \xnameref{pVI:GNW:Polish Civil War}).
\bparag If \POL does not use this \CB, it loses 2 \STAB at the end of the
diplomacy phase of the next turn. This becomes a loss of 3 \STAB if either
\ref{pIV:Liberum Veto} never happened, or Absolutism has been established
(\ref{chSpecific:Poland:Absolutism}) or the dynasty of \payssaxe currently
rules \POL per \ref{pV:Saxon King Poland}.
\bparag This \CB can be used as a reaction to the \CB of \RUS above, or as a
regular \CB.
\bparag If there is a \POLmin (special or normal), apply \ref{pVI:GNW:Minor
  Poland}.
\aparag[Forfeit] If neither \RUS nor \POL use their \CB by the end of next
turn, consider the event played and \SUE is considered to have won the war for
all purposes (especially for the lasting effects).
\bparag If either \RUS or \POL are already at war against \SUE, either can
declare that they transform the war into this event. This is considered as
using the \CB provided by the event (with no \STAB cost in the case of \POL)
and triggers everything triggered by the use of the \CB.
\aparag[Swedish generalisation of the war] If one of \RUS or \POL uses its \CB
to declare war on \SUE, then \SUE has a free \CB against the other one.
\bparag This \CB is used as a reaction to the \CB of \RUS or \POL.
\bparag[Surprise aggression] As an exception, this \CB can be used at the
beginning of any military round of any turn of the war. In this case, the
country enters war without a call for allies.
\aparag[Prussian involvement] If \PRU is a major country, it has a \CB against
either \POL or \SUE (its choice).
\bparag This \CB can be used at the turn of the event or at the next
one. There is no penalty for not using it.
\aparag[Danish aggression] \paysDanemark may enter the war against \SUE (see
\xnameref{pVI:GNW:War Denmark}).
\aparag[Alliances] \RUS, \POL, \PRU or \SUE are not necessarily allied in the
war. They have to sign a formal alliance if they want to be allied.

\tour{After the war begins}

\phadm
\aparag At the first turn of the war (only), \SUE receive reinforcements as a
minor country. It makes one roll in offensive attitude \textbf{and} one in
defensive attitude.
\bparag These reinforcements are \Veteran. They do not count toward this turn
purchase limit.

\phmil
\aparag If the dynasty of \payssaxe rules in \POL, troops of \POL and \SUE can
cross the \HRE in order to wage war in \payssaxe.
\bparag No side may besiege or pillage provinces of the \HRE belonging to
countries not at war.
\aparag Troops of \SUE may enter provinces of \regionUkraine even if they
belong to a country not at war (they may thus trigger \ref{pVI:Mazepa}).
\bparag This gives a free \CB against \SUE to both the owner of the province
and the protector of \paysukraine to be used during the next turn.
% (Jym) In \PPI, the \CB was against enemies of \SUE if \TUR used it. Here,
% \TUR already has a \CB because of the revolt of \leaderMazepa and it gives a
% double \CB to \TUR (against either \RUS or \SUE). Easier to write like that

% (Jym), notes Pierre, small civil war even if absolutism:
\aparag Fortress owned by \POL and controlled by \SUE gives full supply to
\SUE.

\phpaix
\aparag[Starting the Revolt of Mazepa] If there is any \ARMY counter of \SUE
in any province of \regionUkraine at the beginning of the peace phase then
\ref{pVI:Mazepa} will occur next turn. Consider it as the first event rolled
for during the next event phase.
\bparag This revolt will occur even if the peace is signed at this turn. In
this case, the revolt is considered to have occurred at the very end of the
turn, before signing the peace.
\aparag If \SUE signs no unfavourable peace for this war (including if the war
does not occur), it immediately wins 50 \VP.

\effetlong
% (Jym) Err, how about the overseas choice ?  (JCD) Does not matter, the event
% is more specific. Let the third army become a totally normal army.
\aparag If \SUE signs no unfavourable peace for this war (including if the war
does not occur), then \SUE may use up to 3 \ARMY counters in Europe with no
condition on the number of provinces and even if the politics of \ROTW
expansion was chosen earlier.

\begin{digressions}[\payspologne and \paysDanemark in the Great Northern War]


  \digression[pVI:GNW:War Denmark]{War in \paysdanemark}
  % (Jym) : was: \DAN in \EC of \RUS + entry in war.  Reformulation to avoid
  % \minmaxing...  We might need diagrams to know which cases should be
  % needed...
  \aparag If \paysdanemark is inactive:
  \bparag If \RUS declares war on \SUE, then \paysdanemark is put in \CE of
  \RUS and fully enters war against \SUE.
  \bparag If \RUS does not declares war on \SUE, but \POL does, then
  \paysdanemark is put in \CE of \POL and fully enters war against \SUE.
  \aparag If \paysdanemark is already at war against \SUE:
  \bparag If its controller is \RUS or \POL and uses its \CB, then it is
  raised in \EG of its controller.
  \bparag If it is not allied to any \MAJ, it is put in \EC of the first \MAJ
  to use its \CB against \SUE (\RUS first, then \POL).
  \bparag If its controller is \RUS or \POL and does not use its \CB, the war
  goes on but \SUE can now obtain the truce (see \ref{pVI:GNW:Danish Truce}).
  \bparag If \paysdanemark is at war against a \MAJ declaring war to \SUE, it
  immediately proposes a white peace. If another \MAJ declares war to \SUE,
  \paysdanemark is then put in \CE of this \MAJ and enters war against \SUE.
  \aparag Otherwise (\paysdanemark at war against someone not part of the
  Great Northern War), \paysdanemark does not partake to the Great Northern
  War.
  % (Jym) Now included in event \leaderMazepa.
  % \aparag If \paysukraine is at war against \RUS or if
  % \ref{pVI:Mazepa} is occurring, \TUR has a free \CB against \RUS at
  % the next diplomacy phase.
  % \bparag This \CB exists at each turn were one of the conditions is true.

  \phpaix
  \aparag\label{pVI:GNW:Danish Truce} If the capital of \paysdanemark is
  controlled by \SUE at the beginning of a peace phase, or if \paysdanemark
  loses a major defeat (on land or on sea) against \SUE (not its allies), it
  proposes a truce to \SUE.
  \bparag If \SUE accepts the truce, \SUE evacuates the capital of
  \paysdanemark but keeps other controlled provinces.
  \bparag If the peace is signed during this truce, provinces of \paysdanemark
  controlled by \SUE must be taken into account when computing peace
  differential.
  \bparag The truce lasts for 3 turns after which \paysdanemark automatically
  enters back in the war.
  % (Jym) added:
  \bparag During the truce, \paysdanemark stays on the diplomatic track of its
  patron and is still considered at war for all purposes.
  % (Jym) hum, not too sure about that. Especially because of the
  % \seazoneOresund levies


  \digression[pVI:GNW:Polish Civil War]{Polish Civil War}
  \begin{histoire}[Tumult in Poland]
    Multiples candidates losing the Polish crown when Augustus II of Saxony
    was elected in 1697 were still trying to influence the Polish
    politics. They all played a complex political game for the crown during
    this war. Even if he was military forced to abdicate at the treaty of
    Altranst\"{a}dt, Augustus was soon back in the war and got his throne
    back. Sweden did not manage to impose a lasting king, even if Stanislas
    Leszinski was elected for a short and contested reign in 1706. Stanislas
    tried to come back at the death of Augustus, this time with the help of
    France, yielding to the War of Polish Succession.
  \end{histoire}
  % (Jym) More references to IV-A for Absolutism that may also come with the
  % the National Revival in pVII (associated to event of Kosciusko).

  \condition{}
  \aparag If Absolutism has been established in \POL, ignore this sub-event.
  % (Jym) WoPS:Polish Victory establishes Absolutism... What?
  \aparag If \payspologne is a special \EW of either \FRA or \SUE per
  \ref{pVI:WoPS:Polish Victory} or a regular \MIN (without Absolutism), see
  the modifications of the Civil War in \ref{pVI:GNW:Minor Poland}.

  \phmil
  \aparag If a Swedish \ARMY first enters a province owned by \POL and no
  battle (except overrun) occurs, the fortress may surrender to \SUE.
  \bparag Roll 1d10, add the current \STAB of \POL (0 if it is a \MIN), add
  the level of the fortress. If the result is 5 or less, the fortress
  immediately surrenders to \SUE.
  % (Jym) added:
  \bparag \SUE has to stop movement in the province in order to try this
  surrender, but it occurs during its movement segment and not during the
  siege segment.
  % (Jym) added:
  \bparag Troops inside the fortress are redeployed as if \emph{Honor of war}
  had been granted. The fortress does not lose one level for being taken.
  % (Jym) I do hesitate about next point. Possibly too tough to manage with a
  % war that lasts 4 turns. But without that, I am afraid that it would be
  % too powerful to reattempt everywhere until this succeeds. In doubt, I
  % comment, since this was not there before.
  %
  % \bparag This can only occurs once per province during the war.
  %
  % (Jym) Saxony is reliable:
  \bparag Provinces of \payssaxe are not subject to automatic surrender to
  \SUE.

  \phpaix
  \aparag If, at the beginning of a peace phase, \SUE controls \villeVarsovie
  or the \STAB of \POL is 0 or lower, \SUE manages to impose its pretender as
  a king for (part of) \POL.
  \bparag If \payspologne is a \MIN, this can only occurs if \SUE controls
  \villeVarsovie.
  \bparag \SUE receives \leaderwithdata{Poniatowski2}. Remove Polish
  \leaderPoniatowski if in play. If he was not in play (even if already dead),
  he will stay with \SUE for 2 turns.
  \bparag Starting with next turn, \SUE can raise up to one \ARMY\faceplus in
  any controlled or owned national province of \POL. This \ARMY has the class,
  technology and cost of Polish troops. It does not decrease the number of
  Polish (or regular Swedish) counters available. It does not count toward
  purchase limits for \SUE nor for \POL.
  % (Jym) to settle the matter of change if the \ARMY is broken
  \bparag \SUE may not have more than 4\LD worth of ``Polish'' troops and may
  not split them. It may, however, use one \LD counter if needed.
  \bparag This is a Swedish \ARMY and can thus trigger \ref{pVI:Mazepa}.
  \aparag If at the beginning of a peace phase, \SUE controls both
  \villeVarsovie and either \villeDresden (if the \payssaxe dynasty rules
  \POL) or \villeCracovie (otherwise), \POL propose a mandatory truce to \SUE.
  \bparag If \SUE accepts the truce, it may immediately annex one province of
  \POL (\SUE chooses which).
  \bparag This truce can only be imposed once during the war.
  \bparag During the truce, \SUE keeps control of the fortresses it controls
  at the beginning of the truce.
  % (Jym) :
  \bparag However, \POL gives back to \SUE the provinces of \SUE it controls
  at the beginning of the truce.
  \bparag As long as the truce lasts, \SUE can freely cross provinces
  controlled by \POL. They count as enemy provinces for movement purpose and
  \SUE cannot stop in them or pillage them. Supply may cross these provinces.
  \bparag During the truce, \POL do not lose \STAB because of the war (as if
  in armistice).
  \bparag The truce can be broken by \POL either after 3 turns of truce or
  during a turn following a major defeat of \SUE
  \aparag\label{pVI:GNW:Stanislas Victory} If \POL signs an unfavourable
  peace after a truce was imposed (even if broken), then \SUE manage to impose
  its pretender on the throne.
  \bparag The new king of \POL is \monarqueStanislas with values 6/5/6. He
  will last as long as a random length for Minister, see \ref{eco:Excellent
    Minister}. This is a new dynasty.
  \bparag \label{pVI:GNW:Stanislas} As long as \monarqueStanislas rules, \POL
  and \SUE are in defensive alliance and \POL must answer any call for ally
  made by \SUE.


  \digression[pVI:GNW:Minor Poland]{Minor Poland}
  % (Jym) Only WoPS may impose durably the \EG of \POLmin. GNW can do that
  % only for the duration of Stanislas reign (by breaking the \EG of WoPS if
  % needed)

  \activation{These effects modify and overrules the effects of
    \ref{pVI:GNW:Polish Civil War} if \payspologne is already a minor
    country.}

  \phdipl
  \aparag If \payspologne is a regular minor country, it makes a mandatory
  white peace with all its enemies (except \SUE and allies) and uses its \CB
  to declare war on \SUE. It will call for allies as per regular rules.
  \aparag If \payspologne is a regular minor country, apply all the effects of
  \ref{pVI:GNW:Polish Civil War} except \ref{pVI:GNW:Stanislas}. Use the
  following instead: For the reign of \monarqueStanislas, \payspologne is put
  in \EG of \SUE and no diplomacy is allowed on it, after which \payspologne
  becomes a normal minor country.
  \bparag For all purposes except incomes (declarations of war, victory
  conditions, \ldots) consider that special \EG as if \payspologne were a
  \VASSAL of \SUE.
  % (Jym) taken from \PPI. Not sure this is useful...
  \bparag As an exception to the normal rules, the order of preference for
  controlling \payspologne during this war is: \PRU, \FRA, \AUS, \HOL, \ENG,
  \RUS.
  \bparag If \payspologne signs no unfavourable peace during this war, it is
  put in \EG of the country that controlled it. Otherwise, it becomes neutral.
  \aparag[\payspologne special minor of \SUE] Due to \ref{pVI:WoPS:Polish
    Victory}, any declaration of war against \SUE also includes
  \payspologne. Apply \ref{pVI:GNW:Polish Civil War} substituting \RUS for
  \SUE (including the benefits of \leaderPoniatowski and his \ARMY). \RUS can
  impose its pretenders on the throne.
  \bparag If \RUS imposes its pretender on the Polish throne, \payspologne it
  put in \EG of \RUS, with no diplomacy possible, for the reign of
  \monarqueStanislas after which \payspologne becomes a normal minor country.
  \aparag[\payspologne special minor of \FRA] Due to \ref{pVI:WoPS:Polish
    Victory}, \FRA decides whether \payspologne uses its \CB against \SUE or
  not.
  \bparag If \payspologne is at war, it is played by \FRA
  % (Jym) added:
  but \FRA does not have to enter war against \SUE (it \emph{may} choose to do
  so, using the normal \CB of \POL).
  \bparag If \SUE manages to impose its pretender, this breaks the special
  status of \payspologne. It becomes a special \EG of \SUE (as above) for the
  reign of \monarqueStanislas and after that a regular minor country.
  \bparag If \SUE does not manage to impose its pretender, \payspologne stays
  a special \EG of \FRA.

\event{pVI:Jacobite Rebellion}{VI-4}{Jacobite Rebellion}{2}{RistoMod}

\history{1715/1745-46}

\condition{}
% (JCD) Added the mark off part. Obviously, no Jacobite rebellion for Catholic
% \ANG.
\aparag If \ANG is \CATHCR or \CATHCO, roll for two \REVOLT in \ANG, then mark
off and consider as played.
\aparag This event can only happen if \paysecosse is on the diplomatic track
of \ANG or if \ANG owns at least four provinces of \paysecosse. Otherwise, do
not mark off and re-roll.
\aparag There are two rebellions with slightly different initial
conditions. Apply the rules hereafter, but read initial placement in
\xnameref{pVI:Jacobite:First Revolt} or \xnameref{pVI:Jacobite:Bonny Prince
  Charlie}.

\phdipl
\aparag The rebellion is controlled by \FRA if Catholic, otherwise by \HIS.
\aparag If \FRA is \CATHCR, it has a \CB to make a full intervention at the
side of \paysecosse.
\bparag If \FRA is Catholic, it can make a limited intervention at the side of
\paysecosse.
\bparag If \FRA is Protestant, it can make a limited intervention at the side
of \ANG.
\aparag \HOL can make a limited intervention at the side of \ANG.
\aparag \HIS can make a limited intervention at the side of \paysecosse.
\begin{todo}
  Intervention only if Alberoni is or was minister. Need to write Alberoni
  before enforcing this condition.
\end{todo}
\aparag Other countries can make foreign intervention as per normal religious
wars rules (see \ref{chDiplo:Religious Civil War}). \paysecosse is considered
to be Catholic during this war.

\phadm
\aparag Rebels roll for reinforcements in offensive attitude for the duration
of the war.
\bparag Rebels can use the counters of both \paysecosse and \paysroyalistes.
\bparag reinforcements must be put in provinces where there are already rebels
or allied troops (not just \REVOLT ). If none exist, the rebels receive no
reinforcements.

\phmil
\aparag The \REVOLT are supply sources for the rebels and limited supply
sources for their allies.

\phpaix
\aparag \ANG wins if there are no more \REVOLT and either there is no more
rebel \ARMY or the rebels and their allies have suffered one more major defeat
that \ANG this turn.
\bparag In this case, remove all rebel counters from the map.
\bparag \paysecosse get back to the diplomatic position it had before the war
on the English track.
\bparag If \FRA was fully at war, a normal peace has still to be signed.
\aparag The rebels win if the king is overthrown by the \REVOLT or if they
control \villeLondon and there is at least one \REVOLT still in play or if a
fully allied \FRA manages to impose an unconditional surrender to \ANG.
\bparag If the rebels win and were not allied to any \CATHCR country, \ANG
becomes \CATHCO.
\bparag If the rebels win and were allied to a \CATHCR country, \ANG becomes
\CATHCR.
\bparag At the beginning of the next turn, the king of \ANG dies and an
automatic \terme{Dynastic Crisis} occurs in \ANG. This overrules \ref{pVI:Act
  Establishment}.
\aparag Apply the following additional effects if \FRA was fully at war and
manages to impose an unconditional surrender to \ANG:
\bparag \ANG loses 50\VP.
\bparag Events \shortref{pIV:Act Navigation} and \shortref{pVI:Act Union} are
cancelled.
\bparag \ANG makes an enforced dynastic alliance with \FRA and must give a
\COL or \TP of its choice as a dowry.
\bparag \ANG makes an enforced offensive alliance with \FRA for two turns and
must respect it when \FRA calls it as ally.
\bparag \ANG cannot declare war to \FRA for the duration of the new king and
his successor.

``king ranked'' general in a province adjacent to \paysukraine, place an
\ARMY\facemoins instead.
\bparag ``King ranked'' generals are those bearing the king symbol, namely
monarchs, \leader{Carl XII} as an heir to the throne
(\ref{chSpecific:Sweden:Charles XII}) or any Turkish Vizier
(\ref{chSpecific:Turkey:Vizier}).
\aparag The revolt is considered active as long as \leaderMazepa is alive and
at least one \REVOLT exists in one of the provinces of \regionUkraine.

\phdipl
\aparag Any country possessing a province of \regionUkraine with a \REVOLT in
it has a free \CB against either the former or the current protector (its
choice).
\bparag Minor countries use this \CB against the new protector.
\aparag As long as the revolt is active, \TUR as a free \CB against either the
former or the new protector (its choice).

\phadm
\aparag If the revolt is active \paysukraine roll for reinforcements in
offensive attitude, base on the income of the provinces with a \REVOLT in
them.
\bparag The reinforcement roll has a malus of \bonus{-2} unless a ``king
ranked'' leader of the new protector is in or adjacent to \paysukraine.

\phmil
% (Jym) Add a limited supply for \paysukraine else it may botch if it falls
% out of war and Mazepa has zero supply
\aparag \REVOLT are limited supply sources for the troops of \paysukraine but
are not supply source for the protector.
% (Jym) added, so that \REVOLT may spawn as long as the \ARMY is there
\aparag If a stack containing troops of \paysukraine takes a fortress, place a
\REVOLT \facemoins in the province.

\phpaix
\aparag The \REVOLT can extend in any province of \regionUkraine.
\bparag \REVOLT in \paysUkraine cause loss of \STAB to the \textbf{former}
protector. Other \REVOLT in \regionUkraine cause loss of \STAB to the owner of
the province as per normal rules.
\aparag If the new protector signs a white or favourable peace while the
revolt is still active, all the provinces of \regionUkraine belonging to
countries that were at war against the new protector during this war are
annexed by the \MIN \paysukraine. The new protector gain all the benefits of
\ref{pIV:Revolt Cossacks}.
\aparag Otherwise, the former protector stays protector of \paysukraine (with
the provinces still belonging to the minor after the peace is signed).
